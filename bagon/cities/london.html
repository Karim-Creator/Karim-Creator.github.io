            <h2>London</h2>
            <hr>
            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>London is situated in southeastern England, lying astride the River Thames some 50 miles (80 km) upstream from its estuary on the North Sea. In satellite photographs the metropolis can be seen to sit compactly in a Green Belt of open land,
                with its principal ring highway (the M25 motorway) threaded around it at a radius of about 20 miles (30 km) from the city centre. </p>

            <h5>History</h5>
            <p>Historically, London grew from three distinct centres: the walled settlement founded by the Romans on the banks of the Thames in the 1st century CE, today known as the City of London, “the Square Mile,” or simply “the City”; facing it across
                the bridge on the lower gravels of the south bank, the suburb of Southwark; and a mile upstream, on a great southward bend of the river, the City of Westminster. The three settlements had distinct and complementary roles. London, “the
                City,” developed as a centre of trade, commerce, and banking. Southwark, “the Borough,” became known for its monasteries, hospitals, inns, fairs, pleasure houses, and the great theatres of Elizabethan London—the Rose (1587), the Swan (1595),
                and the world-famous Globe (1599). Westminster grew up around an abbey, which brought a royal palace and, in its train, the entire central apparatus of the British state—its legislature, executive, and judiciary.</p>
            <p>It also boasts spacious parks and the most fashionable districts for living and shopping—the West End. The north-bank settlements merged into a single built-up area in the early decades of the 17th century, but they did not combine into a
                single enlarged municipality.</p>
            <p>The City of London was unique among Europe’s capital cities in retaining its medieval boundaries. Westminster and other suburbs were left to develop their own administrative structures—a pattern replicated a hundred times over as London exploded
                in size, becoming the prototype of the modern metropolis.</p>
            <p>The evacuation and bombing during World War II were a turning point in London’s history because they brought the long era of expansive suburbanization to a sudden end. After the war the government decided that the metropolis had grown too
                much for its own economic and social good and that its growth was a strategic risk. A Green Belt was imposed, and subsequent growth was diverted beyond it. Finally, London’s administrative boundaries were redrawn to incorporate almost
                the entire physical metropolis, resulting in present-day Greater London (see the table Greater London at a Glance).</p>

            <h5>Description</h5>
            <p>London is breathtakingly beautiful. The serene skies filled with soft puffs of clouds that cloak the glory of the majestic sun. The gorgeous trees slumping with the burden of saying goodbye to the leaves that held onto them for three seasons.
                It can be felt in that early morning breeze that caresses your cheeks and flirts with you. The slow withering of the leaves from green to yellow to brown. The brown carpet laid out on the streets, welcoming you as a sign of Autumn's arrival.
                London is in those tall buildings made of steel, concrete, and glass such as the Shard, but also in those cute, colourful houses lined up in Notting Hill.</p>
            <p>London may not be the wettest place on Earth but it's weather is still quite fickle. You can set out of the house armed with an umbrella and a raincoat after a peek at the weather forecast and return home without a drop of rain.</p>
