            <h2>Tokyo</h2>
            <hr>
            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>Tokyo should be considered in the same tourist destination of world class international cities like Paris, London and New York. Tokyo is the financial, political and commerce heart of Japan. While the pace of the city can be overwhelming,
                we will show the quiet,tranquil side of this great city. The city was historically referred to as Edo. In 2003, celebrated the 400th birthday of Tokyo. </p>

            <h5>History</h5>
            <p>Tokyo has an incredible variety of museums, galleries, shrines and temples to keep you preoccupied for many days. In the city of Tokyo there is a wide spectrum of places to visit, from the very distinguished Imperial Palace, home of the Emperor
                and past shogunates, the legendary Tokyo Tower, and Tokyo Sky Tree, the new landmark of Tokyo. </p>
            <p>And within Tokyo, like many other capital cities of Asian countries with a long history, there is historic neighbourhoos, revealing glimpses of vanishing traditional Japanese culture. And please do not forget to visit the Hakone resort area
                outside Tokyo, showcasing the splendour of Mount Fuji.</p>
            <p>Tokyo is the center of business, trade, and industry of Japan and also of Asia. The city is the center of the largest metropolitan area in the world. It faces Tokyo Bay. It became the capital city of Japan in the middle of 19th century, when
                its name changed from "Edo" to "Tokyo". Before then, Kyoto was the capital of Japan. </p>
            <p>Tokyo has many sight-seeing spots, but very few of them are old. There are very few buildings in Tokyo that are more than 50 years old. Popular places for visitors range from Tokyo Tower in the center of the city to Mount Takao out in the
                western countryside. Tokyo Skytree is a new tower and is the tallest in Japan. Traditional religious sights such as Meiji Shrine and Sensō-ji attract many tourists. The Imperial Palace can be seen in the middle of the city, but is not
                open to the public.</p>

            <h5>Description</h5>
            <p>Tokyo is a world unto itself, and it’s an absolute must-see for any travel lover. Soak in the traditional Japanese culture, learn about modern life in the city, become a real-life cartoon character and people watch until your head spins. Not
                to mention the unique, eclectic and delicious selection of restaurants. There’s no place like Tokyo</p>
            <p>Tokyo is an amazing destination for LGBTQ+ women and same-sex couples! LGBTQ+ laws in Japan are more progressive than most other countries in Asia, and acceptance of the community is growing in Japanese culture. We felt very safe on our trip
                and the locals were extremely welcoming. The Ni-chome district in Shinjuku is Tokyo’s gayborhood, and we highly recommend the district’s lesbian bar, Goldfinger!</p>
