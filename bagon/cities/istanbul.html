            <h2>Istanbul</h2>
            <hr>
            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>This much we can tell you right away: Istanbul is a city you absolutely must see for yourself. The pulsating vibes of the Metropolis is hard to put into words – this city exudes life like no other.</p>
            <p>At the same time, Istanbul is so unique and unlike any other city. It is literally a collision of two worlds – the European continent meets the Asian continent and creates a fusion, that is Istanbul. What’s so fascinating is that Istanbul
                is the only Metropolis in the world that encompasses two continents. This Turkish city is divided into two parts. There are two sides, two continents, two cultures. It is this contradiction that makes Istanbul one of the most intriguing
                cities we have ever been to.</p>

            <h5>Safety</h5>
            <p>Unfortunately, Istanbul isn’t all beautiful. By that, we think back to the terrorist attacks in 2016 and 2017, which led to a massive slump in tourism. On top of all that, they also have a tense political situation.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, reducing Istanbul to terror and the coup attempt would never do justice to the city. In the end, Istanbul is a great city that really impressed us and is one we will surely return to again.</p>
            <h5>Activities in Istanbul</h5>
            <p>Many sights in Istanbul can be reached quite easily by foot. You are best to start off directly in the historic quarter of Sultanahmet in the Fatih district. Here you will find all the main tourist attractions in the Old Centre of Istanbul,
                including the world famous Hagia Sophia.</p>
            <p>Once you cross the Galata Bridge, you will reach the other side of the Golden Horn in the Beyoglu district – the modern side of Istanbul. Here, the focus is no longer on the sightseeing, but more on the Turkish lifestyle. Nevertheless, there
                are some places worth seeing here as well.</p>
            <hr>
            <h5>Best</h5>
            <p>Eating fish sandwiches on Galata Bridge and haggling in the Grand Bazaar… most guide books will describe these as unmissable experiences. But there’s plenty more to Istanbul. Here is my guide to the perfect 24 hours in an incredible city!
                10.00: First stop, get your bearings by heading to Konak</p>
            <p>There’s a beautiful story behind Istanbul’s Rainbow Steps, guaranteed to put a smile on your face. Some pre-trip research on Istanbul in Turkey, brought up some very colourful photos on Instagram. They were of the so-called ‘Rainbow Steps’
                linking the arty districts of Findikli and Cihangir. </p>
